Authentication Credentials
    Types of credentials:
        Where you are (CCM)
        What you have (key fob to lock your car
        what you are (facial recognition)
        etc.
    
What you know: Passwords
    User logging in to a system
        asked to identify:  username
        asked to authenticate:  password
    Passwords are the most common type of authentication today
    provide only weak protection
        actions can be taken to strengthen passwords
        
Password Weaknesses
    linked to human memory - can only memorize a limited number of items
    long, complex passwords most effective, but difficult to memorize
    users must remember many passwords for many accounts
    each account should be unique
    security policies mandate that passwords must expire
        even more things to memorize.

    users take shortcuts
        weak passwords: common words, short passwords, or personal info
    when attempting to create stronger passwords, generally follow predictable patterns:
        appending: using letters, numbers, punctuation in a pattern
        replacing: users use replacements in predictable patterns

Check password strength
    many tools available online to check password strength
    (Don't enter actual password)

Attacks on Passwords
    attacks that can be used to discover passwords:
        social engineering
            phishing, shoulder surging, dumpster diving
        capturing
            keyloggers, man-in-the-middle, resetting, attacker gains physical access to computer and resets password

    Offline attacks
        method most used today
        attackers steal file of password digests (hashed, encrypted list of usernames/passwords)
            compares with digests of passwords and usernames they have created themselves

    Brute force
        every possible combination of letters, numbers, and characters used to create encrypted passwords and matched against stolen file
        slowest, most thorough method

    Mask attack
        form of brute force, knows some information about the password (e.g. certain characters)
    Rule attack
        conducts statistical analysis on the stolen passwords that is used to create a mask to break the largest number of passwords
            (e.g. knows min and max length of passwords)

    Dictionary attacks
        attacker creates digests of common dictionary words
        compares against stolen digest file

    Rainbow tables
        creates large pre-generated data set of candidate digests
        inputs the hashed value, returns the unencrypted password

    Password collections
        in 2009, attacker used an SQL injection attack and more than 32 million user passwords (in cleartext) were stolen
        These passwords provided two key elements for password attacks
            gave attackers large corpus of real-world passwords
            have provided attackers advanced insight into the strategic thinking of how users create passwords

Password Security
    Securing passwords from attacks depends upon the user as well as the enterprise
    for the user
        involves properly managing passwords
    for the enterprise
        involves protecting the password digests

    Managing passwords
        most critical factor is length
        in addition to length:
            do not use passwords that consist of dictionary or phonetic words
            no repetition
            no password reusing

    Password managers
        technology used for securing passwords
        three basic types of password manager:
            password generators
            online vaults
            password management applications

What you have: Tokens, Cards, and Cell Phones
    Multi-factor authentication
        when a user is using more than one type of authentication credential
        ex: what a user knows and what a user has could be used together for authentication (password and keycard/fingerprint)
    Single-factor authentication
        using just one type of authentication

Tokens
    used to create a one time password (OTP)
    Hardware security token
        typically a small device with a window LED display
    Software security token
        stored on a general purpose device (like smartphone)
    two types of OTPs:
        time based
            synced with an authentication server
            generated with an algorithm
            changes every 30 to 60 seconds
        event driven
            changes when specific event occurs
    advantages over passwords
        change frequently
        can be nullified quickly

Cell phones
    increasingly replacing tokens and cards
        code can be sent through app or texted
        allows user to send a request via the phone to receive an HOTP authorization code

What you are: BioMetrics
    standard
        hand, face, eyes, unique physical characteristic
    voice recognition uses a standard microphone
    iris scanner used standard webcam
    facial recognition uses landmarks called nodal points to identify facial structure
    disadvantages
        high cost
        some amount of error
        can be tricked

    Cognitive Biometrics
        relates to perception, thought processes, understanding of the user
        easier for user to remember, based on user's life experiences
        difficult to imitate
    
    Behavioral biometrics
        authentications by normal actions the user performs
        Keystroke dynamics
            attempts to recognizer the user's typing rhythm
                all users type at different paces
                over 90% effective

Where you are: Geolocation
    identification of the location of a person or object using technology
    Used most often to reject imposters instead of accepting authorized users

Single Sign-on
    Identity management
        using a single authentication credential shared across multiple networks
    it is called federated identity management (FIM) when networks are owned by different organizations
    single sign on (SSO) holds promise to reduce burden of usernames and passwords to just one.

account management
    managing user account passwords
        can be done by setting password rules
        too cumbersome to manage on a user-by-user basis
            security risk if one user setting is overlooked
    other steps to take
        shared accounts, generic accounts, guest accounts should be prohibited
        closely monitor any privileged accounts
        disable account passwords instead of deleting accounts no longer being used
        create strict policies regarding password recovery
    transitive trust
        two way relationship that is automatically created between parent and child accounts
