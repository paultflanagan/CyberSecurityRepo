Assessing the Security Posture
    will reveal the existing vulnerabilities that must be addressed
variety of tools and techniques can be used

What is a vulnerability assessment?
    Systematic and methodical evaluation of the security of the enterprise
    
Asset Identification
    Process of inventorying items with economic value
    Common assets in order of value, most to least:
        5.  Data
        4.  Physical Assets
        3.  People
        2.  Hardware
        1.  Software
        
    Factors for value determination:
        How critical the asset is to the goals of the organization
        how much revenue the asset generates
        how difficult to replace
        impact of asset unavailability to the organization
    Sometimes a numeric value is assigned for each asset
        5 is usually most valuable and 1 is least valuable
        
Threat Evaluation
    List potential threats that come from threat agents
    
    Threat modeling
        goal: understand attackers and their methods
        often done by constructing threat scenarios
    Attack tree
        provides visual representation of potential attacks
        drawn as an inverted tree structure
        
Exercise: Draw two attack trees
1. Breaking into this room
2. Breaking into admin account

Vulnerability appraisal
    determine current weaknesses
    takes a snapshot of current organization security
    every asset should be analyzed

risk assessment
    determine possibilities for damage
    determine likelihood for each
    
Risk mitigation
    determine what to do about risks
    determine how mush risk can be tolerated
    
Vulnerability assessment tools
    port scanners
    protocol analyzers
    vulnerability scanners
    honeypots and honeynets
    
Port scanners
    TCP/IP communication
        involves information exchange between one system's program and another system's corresponding program
        uses a numeric value as an identifier to the applications and services on these systmes (port numbers)
        each number corresponds to a different process, can figure out what is running on the target machine
        
Protocol analyzers
    capture packets
    analyze what traffic is running over your network
    ex: Wireshark

Vulnerability scanners
    active scanners:
        probe the network and respond what needs evaluation
    passive scanners:
        tells you about what is vulnerable, but can't take action

Honeypot and Honeynet
    Honeypot: computer protected by minimal security
        contains bogus files
        used to see how attackers are approaching their targets
    Honeynet: collection of honeypots
    
Vulnerability Scanning
    an automated software searches through a system for known threats
    
Penetration testing
    designed to exploit system's weaknesses
    relies on the tester's skill, knowledge, cunning
    usually conducted by independent contractor
    
    Three types:
        black box test: tester has no prior knowledge about the target company
        white box test: knows info about the company, can perform fuller depth, but not always as realistic
        grey box test:  knows limited information
        
    Once results have been acquired:
        performs initial exploitation by using that information to determine if it provides entry to the secure network
        
Practicing Data Privacy and Security
    Enterprise data theft may involve stealing user information
    
Security Posture
    describes an approach, philosophy or strategy regarding security
