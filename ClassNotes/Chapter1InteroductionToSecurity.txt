Securing information
    No simple solution
    Many different types of attacks
    Defending is often difficult
    
Today's Security Attacks
    Examples
        Weekly Presentations
    Remotely controlling a car
    Tampering with aircraft systems
    Yahoo accounts compromised by attackers
//  Subscribe to USCert and NJCCIC mailing lists for quick alerts

Reasons for Successful Attacks  Widespread Vulnerabilities
    Configuration issues
    Poorly designed software
    Hardware limitations
    Enterprise-based issues
//  "With security, there's no return on investment"
//  You only prevent the loss of money, tough for small companies to budget for it.

Difficulties in Defending Against Attacks
    With every positive advancement in technology comes with a way for attackers to exploit it.
    
What is Information Security?
    Before defense is possible, one must understand:
        Exactly what security is
        How security relates to information security
        
Understanding "Security"
    Security is:
        Goal: to be free from danger
        the process that achieves that freedom
    As security is increased, convenience is often decreased.
        The more secure something is, the less convenient is may become to use.
        
Defining Information Security
    Information security - the tasks of securing information that is in a digital format:
        Manipulated by a microprocessor
        Preserved on a storage device
        Transmitted over a network
    Information security goal: protect
    
    Three types of information protection (often called "CIA"):
        Confidentiality:
            Only approved individuals may access information
        Integrity
            Information is correct and unaltered
        Availability
            Information is accessible to authorized users
        (Privacy
            kept private)
            
    Policies and Procedures
        v   v   v
    People
        v   v   v
    Products
    
    Products:   For the security around the data, locks to network security equipment
    People:     Those who implement and properly use product to protect dsts
    Policies:   Plans and policies for people to follow
    
    Asset 
        item that has value
    Threat
        Type of action that has the potential to cause harm
    Threat Actor
        Person or element with power to carry out a threat.
        
Information Security Terminology
    Vulnerability
        Flaws or weakness that allows a threat agent to bypass security
    Threat vector
        The means by which an attack can occur
    Risk
        situation involves exposure to some type of danger
    Risk response technical issues:
        Accept -    risk is acknowledged but no steps are attke en to address
        transfer -  assign fix to another actor
        Avoid -     
        Mitigate
        
Understanding the importance of information security
Information security can be helpful

Preventing data theft
    often the primary objective of an organization's info security
    Enterprise data theft involves stealing proprietary business info
    Personal data theft = credit card numbers
    
Thwarting Identity theft
    Identity theft
        Stealing another person's personal information
        Usually using it for financial gain
        
Legal Instances
    HIPAA
        need to sign forms to disclose info to parents
        companies can't hold your information after you stop working for them
    "Sarbox" (2002)
        Public company accounting reform
        US federal Law
        Scandals in large companies 
    GLBA
        Must inform users what they intend to do with the data they collect.
        Pre-GDPR stuff
    PCIDSS  (2006)
        Global standard for how companies handle online payment
        How data is handled when card info is entered, cards are swiped, etc.
        "PCI Compliant"
    California's Database Security Breach Notification Act (2003)
        Any organization in California
        Storage of unencrypted information, had to notify every effected individual
        Unanimous vote after a recent breach in 2003
        Every state has a law similar to this, now.
    CCPA (2018, 2020)
        Signed into Law June 2018 by Governor Jerry Brown
        Will go into effect 01-Jan-2020
        Must be more transparent in the event of data collection, sale, opportunity for removal, and data discrimination
        Applies to companies operating in California or deal with the data of California Residents
        Must "proactively explain privacy notices to consumers when personal information is collected"
    GDPR (2018)
        European Data Protection and Fraud Law
        Addresses export of any personal data outside of EU
        
Maintaining Productivity 
    Post-attack clean up diverts resources away from normal activities
        Time(!), money, and resources
        
Foiling cyberterrorism
    Cyberterrorism
        Any premeditated, politically motivated attack against information, computer systems, computer programs, and data
    Designed to
        Cause panic
        Provoke violence
        Result in financial catastrophe
    
    Threat actor - a generic term used to describe individuals who launch attacks agains other users and their computers
        Most have a goal of financial gain
        
Script Kiddies
    Individuals who want to attack computers yet they lack the knowledge of computers to launch large scale attack
    
Hacktivists
    Attackers who attack for ideological reasons
    Breaking into a website and changing the contents to make a statement
    Shutting down a website to halt online activity by an organization
    
Nation State Actors
    commissioned by the governments to attack enemies' information systems
        May target foreign governments
        
Insiders
    employees, contractors, business partners
    Over 58% percent of breaches attributed to insiders
    
Defending against attacks

Layering
    Info security should be in layers
        Single defense is easy to circumvent
Limiting
    Limit access to info
        Reduces the threat against it
    Only those who must use data should be granted access
        should be limited to only what they need to do their job
Diversity
    Like layering
    Layers must be different
    Same techniques will not be effective against all layers
Obscurity
    obscure details to outsiders
    type of computer, operating system versions, etc.
Simplicity
    simple to organization, complex to outside
    Nature of info security is complex
    
Frameworks and Reference architectures
    Industry standard frameworks and reference architectures
