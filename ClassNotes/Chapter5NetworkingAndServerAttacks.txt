Server Based Attacks
    Man in the Middle
        Threat actor intercepts all communications between two or more parties and corrupts the data
        Denies Alice's credentials, receives all of Bob's information
    Man in the Browser
        intercepts communications, but between browser and the underlying computer
        usually enters by way of a Trojan
        captures all data from the fields
        potential to modify the data as well
        less of a profile, distributed through a Trojan so harder to identify, can lay dormant for months
    Replay
        Makes copy of transmission before allowing it to pass through to the target
        Uses the copy later
        Able to easily take login credentials
    Poisoning
        Introducing a substance that harms or destroys
        ARP Poisoning
            Address Resolution Protocol
            imitates another computer by changing its MAC address.
            MAC Addresses stored in cache for future reference
        DNS Poisoning
            Domain Name System is the current basis for name resolution to IP Address
            Used to redirect computers to chosen address
            Masks itself as the target computer to send it to its chosen addresses
        Privilege Escalation
            Access rights are privileges that are granted to users
            Exploits vulnerabilities to gain access to resources usually restricted
            Vertical and Horizontal: Vertical = higher user, Horizontal = same user
Server Attacks
    Compromised server can provide threat actors with privileged contents and provide opening to attack any devices on the server
    
    Denial of Service (DoS)
        deliberate attempt to prevent authorized users from accessing system by overwhelming with requests
        floods with traffic to make inaccessible to public
        SYN flood attack takes advantage of procedures used for initiating a connection
        
    Web Server Application Attacks
        More difficult to secure a web application than protecting other systems
            Internet is constantly changing and much larger than other systems
        Web server takes its application data through many different Application servers, and them from other Database servers
        Even if you're just in control of the Web server, it has vulnerabilities stemming from each of these contributing servers 
            You have minimal control over these, and they can impact the security of the Web server.
            
    Cross Site Attacks
        Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks intercept the information transfer with a malicious website
        the threat actor's instructions are sent to the user and compromises the victim's data
        
    Injection Attacks
        Introduces new and tailored input to exploit vulnerabilities, often in input fields.
        Most Common: SQL Injection
        
    Hijacking
        Several server attacks are the result of threat actors commandeering a technology and then using it for an attack
        Session Hijacking
            attacker attempts to impersonate user by stealing or guessing session token
            (Session token = unique, random string assigned to an interaction between user and web app.)
            
        URL Hijacking
            User is directed to a fake look-a-like URL (like "googel.com") resulting from a typo, and the page is filled with ads
            Threat actors are also registering domain names that are one bit different (called "bitsquatting")
            
        Domain Hijacking
            domain pointer that links a domain to a specific web server is modified to point to a different server by a threat actor.
            
        Clickjacking
            Tricking user into clicking a link that is other than what it appears to be
            
        Overflow attacks
            Designed to "overflow" areas of memory with instructions from the attacker, 
            Buffer overflow, Integer overflow, etc.
            
        Advertising Attacks
            "Malvertising"
            Uses third party advertising networks to distribute malware to users visiting well-known sites
            
        Browser Vulnerabilities
            Extensions, Add-ons...
            Scripting Code
                Adds dynamic content
                JavaScript, for example
                Embedded in HTML docs, can introduce security concerns
                Can capture and transmit user information due to the access rights granted by the browser by default
                if the security mechanisms are not strong enough, the JavaScript can run in the background and execute various scripts
            Extensions
                expand the normal capabilities of a web browser
                Most are written in JavaScript
                "Browser independent"
            Plug-ins
                Adds new functionality, a single plug-in can be used on different browser
            Add-ons
                adds greater degree of functionality
            
            Due to the risks of these features, efforts are being made to reduce dependence on these.
            
            Plug ins link to external programs (Outside of the web browser), Add-ons add functionality to the browser itself (Part of the web browser)
