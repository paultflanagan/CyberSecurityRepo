Security through network devices
    Can be done through standard devices as well as specially designed hardware
    
Standard Network Devices
    Split into 7 layers
    Devices can be classified by which layers they function within
    Each layer cooperates with adjacent layers
    Improper configuration of devices introduce vulnerabilities.
    
    Bridges
        Hardware device or software that joins two separate computer networks to enable communication between them
        most OSs allow software bridges to connect two LANs, can create vulnerabilities
        
    Switches
        connects two network hosts intelligently
        learns which device is connected to each port
        stores these MAC addresses in a list
        Like a smarter form of a bridge
        Can be configured to be resistant to loops, floods, and broadcast storms
        Threat Actors perform MAC flooding attack done by overflowing the switch with spoofed Ethernet frames that contain different source MAC addresses, causing an echoing clogging of the bandwidth
        Flood Guards can limit the number of MAC addresses that can be learned to prevent this.
        
    Routers
        Forward Packets across different computer networks
        
    Load Balancers
        Evenly distribute work across a network
        Allocate requests among multiple devices.
        
        Optimizes bandwidth usage of computers on a network
        Achieved through software or hardware devices
        Grouped into two categories, Layer 7 and Layer 4
        Different scheduling protocols can be used:
            Round Robin
            Affinity
            Explicitly assigned
            
    Proxies
        several types used in networking
            Forward proxy
            Application / multipurpose proxy
            Reverse proxy
            Transparent proxy
        Advantages:
            Stronger Security: connections are masked better, your own personal IP address is not used
        
Network Security Hardware
    Firewalls
        software- or hardware-based (hardware is more secure but more expensive and harder to setup)
        Both types inspect packers and either accept or deny entry
        All modern OSs include a software firewall ("host-based firewall")
        Hardware firewalls are also separate from the host computers, so that if something goes wrong on the host, the hardware firewall is not immediately at risk like a software firewall would be
        
    Network-Based Firewalls
        Methods of firewall packet filtering
            Stateless packet filtering: makes choices based on the actual content of the received data
            Stateful packet filtering:  depends on where the content came from, the connection
        Firewall actions on a packet:
            Allow:  info goes through
            Drop:   No from both
            Reject: No to receiver, send info back to sender
            
        Rule-based firewalls
            performs actions based on set rules
        Application aware firewalls
            blocks certain types of applications
        Web application firewalls
            blocks specific types of HTTP info
            
    Virtual Private Network (VPN)
        Types:
            Remote access:  User to LAN
            Site to Site:   between multiple sites
            Always on:      from anywhere
        
        VPN concentrator
            aggregates hundreds of VPN connections
        When using a VPN, two options
            all traffic sent to the VPN concentrator and protected
            only some is routed over the secure VPN, while other traffic directly accesses the Internet
            
    Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention
        Intrusion Detection System (IDS) detects attacks as they occur
        
        Two types: 
            Host intrusion detection system (HIDS)
                software based
                detects attack as it occurs
                    installed on each system needing protection
                monitors
                    system calls and file system access
            Network intrusion detection system (NIDS)
                watches for attacks on the network
                is installed on firewalls and routers
                gathers info and reports back to the central device
                can sound alarms and log events
                
    Intrusion Prevention Systems
        IPS
            monitors network traffic to immediately block malicious attacks
            
    Security and Information Event Management (SIEM)
        consolidates real-time monitoring and management of security info
        analyzes and reports on security events
        
    Demilitarized Zone
        location that is separate so that customers do not take the same paths as employees
            increases security
    
    Network segregation
        physical network segregation: isolations the network so that it is not accessible by outsiders
        Virtual LAN (VLAN)
        
Security through Network software
    Network Access Control (NAC)
        examines current state of a system or network device before it can connect to the network
        Goal: prevent suspicious users from accessing the rest of the network
    
    Data Loss Prevention
        system of security tools designed to recognize and identify data that is critical and ensures that is is protected
        most use content inspection
        when policy violation detected, it is reported back to the DLP server
