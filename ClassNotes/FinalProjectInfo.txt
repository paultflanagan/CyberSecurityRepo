Easier to do not at your own house.
Ideas for subject
	Maybe go to GenSpace?
        might be fun, easy, dad would be enthusiastic about it I'm sure
        
Finals have been 40 pages, not expecting 40 pages. 
20 pages..?
    Will have pictures, screen shots...
    Outline itself will be ~2 pages.
    Don't freak out about the suggested length.

DON'T WAIT until the week before

//  At least talk to dad about it
//      say I'm thinking about visiting GenSpace a couple of times for the project 
//      Will also give me a chance to get a better idea of what the project will entail.

An example (which we reviewed) will be uploaded.

Outline at least 3 devices.
Again, don't stress over the length of the paper.

First deadline (Summary, Outline, Rough Draft) due by 07-Mar-2018
Final due last 2 weeks of class


"Remediations" do not need to be short term, they can be long term
ex: Short term: wi-fi has no password:      set a password
    Long term:  house has no front door:    install one
