Easier to do not at your own house.
Ideas for subject
	Maybe go to GenSpace?
        might be fun, easy, dad would be enthusiastic about it I'm sure
        
Finals have been 40 pages, not expecting 40 pages. 
20 pages..?
    Will have pictures, screen shots...
    Outline itself will be ~2 pages.
    Don't freak out about the suggested length.

DON'T WAIT until the week before

//  At least talk to dad about it
//      say I'm thinking about visiting GenSpace a couple of times for the project 
//      Will also give me a chance to get a better idea of what the project will entail.

An example (which we reviewed) will be uploaded.

Outline at least 3 devices.
Again, don't stress over the length of the paper.

First deadline (Summary, Outline, Rough Draft) due by 07-Mar-2018
Final due last 2 weeks of class


"Remediations" do not need to be short term, they can be long term
ex: Short term: wi-fi has no password:      set a password
    Long term:  house has no front door:    install one

You will have to have some sort of presentation on your project
will not be graded on the actual presentation, you will just have to give one.

Rough draft due in two weeks
Parts 1, 2, and 3 should be completed
    Summary, outline / table of contents, and rough draft
        Summary - 1 paragraph of background
        Outline - 5 topics under each of the 6 main topics (minimum 30 total)
            1.  Network / Wireless Security
            2.  PC / Server / Device Security
            3.  Backups / DR
            4.  AAA
            5.  Physical Security
            6.  User Education
        Rough Draft working through some of the 30 topics - the more work you put into this now, the less you will have to have done the second half of the semester.
    
    Format of whole paper:
        Title Page
        Outline / Table of Contents
        Introduction
            Scope (in-out)
        Summary
        Top 5 list (Recommendations)
        Site Activities Schedule (DATES)
        Devices in Scope
    
    Top 5 List each has 5 sections:
        Explanation
        Risk   
        Observation / Examples
        Documentation (pictures, etc.)
        Recommendation
        
        
Plan to talk to Dad more about any chances to come and visit GenSpace

Talked with Dad, am visiting GenSpace to do the project.
Let's put together a draft now so that I know what to ask about and to look for when I get there and don't waste too much time

Creating ~/FinalProject/EarlyPlanning.txt
Moving this text file to ~/FinalProject/

Adding the provided help documents from online into ~/FinalProject/

Need, for Thursday, the Summary, the Outline, and the Rough Draft.


Include the following information at the top of each section page:

    Class ID
    Semester
    Student Name
    Customer description in one or two sentences
    
    
    Class ID:               CMP-124
    Semester:               Spring 2019
    Name:                   Paul Flanagan
    Customer Description:   Michael Flanagan: current president of the Board of Directors at GenSpace, a community genetic engineering lab in NYC.



Summary:
Write a one or two paragraph summary on your security analysis. 
Briefly explain who your customer is, what type of network they have, what some of your key concerns are. 
Include FIVE or more questions that you want to ask the customer about their network. 
These should be questions that will give you information that will help you prepare for the analysis. 
If YOU are the customer, write down five questions that you want answered by the security analysis.


The Customer in this project is my father, and I will be visiting GenSpace, the lab in New York City where he works.
From earlier questions, I know that at GenSpace the researchers primarily use a wi-fi network for internet and file access.
I plan to find out if he has any ethernet-connected devices, what sort of wi-fi security measures he employs, whether their network uses a firewall, how they typically handle file transferring, and which individuals have different access rights and privileges over their network.



Outline:
Consider the following Security Analysis categories that were discussed in class and are contained in the security analysis template:
    Network/Wireless Security
    System (PC/Server) Security
    Backups/Disaster Recovery
    Physical Security
    AAA (Authorization/Authentication/Accounting)
    User Education
For EACH of the above categories, create five to seven topics/questions in each category that you will analyze for your customer.
Then, for each topic/question, write a brief action item describing how you will approach that topic for your customer.


Network/Wireless Security
    1.  Does wi-fi have password?
    2.  What sort of network equipment is used?
    3.  How many devices are permanently connected to the network?
    4.  Does the network possess any hardware or software firewall?
    5.  Are their protocols for planned network maintenance?
    
System (PC/Server) Security
    1.  How is it decided whether a device can connect to the network?
    2.  What software, e.g. firewalls, is used to protect individual devices?
    3.  How often do common devices undergo software updates?
    4.  What is the oldest device connected to the network?
    5.  How many devices are permanently connected to the wi-fi?
    
Backups/Disaster Recovery
    1.  How is vital data stored on site?
    2.  Is any backup software used?
    3.  How often is data backed up?
    4.  Are there off site backup locations?
    5.  How often are off site backups updated?
    
Physical Security
    1.  Where is router stored, and how is it protected?
    2.  Where are any permanently wi-fi connected devices stored, and how are they protected?
    3.  Who has access to these locations?
    4.  Are there any publicly accessible ethernet ports?
    5.  How old are the locks on the building?
    
AAA (Authorization/Authentication/Accounting)
    1.  In what ways can users access the network?
    2.  How are users of the network identified and categorized?
    3.  What sorts of privileges do different users have?
    4.  How is user activity tracked and monitored?
    5.  Is any AAA software being used for the network?
    
User Education
    1.  Is there a standard procedure to follow when users transfer data over network?
    2.  Do users understand common sources of threat risks?
    3.  Are users encouraged to exercise secure data management practices?
    4.  Has there been a history of previous data leaks at this network?
    5.  What is the contingency plan for handling a data leak?    5.  
    
    
    
Rough Draft
It is recommended that you try to write about at least one potential or actual vulnerability under each category for this rough draft. 
The more you have completed, the more useful my feedback will be.

Sounds like we don't need to have all five items under each topic for the midterm?
It's possible that this is referring to a different aspect, though
