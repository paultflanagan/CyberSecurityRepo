Customer Description:   Michael Flanagan: current president of the Board of Directors at GenSpace, a community genetic engineering lab in NYC.


//  Summary
The Customer in this project is my father, and I will be visiting GenSpace, the lab in New York City where he works.
From earlier questions, I know that at GenSpace the researchers primarily use a wi-fi network for internet and file access.
I plan to find out if he has any ethernet-connected devices, what sort of wi-fi security measures he employs, whether their network uses a firewall, how they typically handle file transferring, and which individuals have different access rights and privileges over their network.


//  Outline
Network/Wireless Security
    1.  Does wi-fi have password?
    2.  What sort of network equipment is used?
    3.  How many devices are permanently connected to the network?
    4.  Does the network possess any hardware or software firewall?
    5.  Are there protocols for planned network maintenance?
    
System (PC/Server) Security
    1.  How is it decided whether a device can connect to the network?
    2.  What software, e.g. firewalls, is used to protect individual devices?
    3.  How often do common devices undergo software updates?
    4.  What is the oldest device connected to the network?
    5.  How many devices are permanently connected to the wi-fi?
    
Backups/Disaster Recovery
    1.  How is vital data stored on site?
    2.  Is any backup software used?
    3.  How often is data backed up?
    4.  Are there off site backup locations?
    5.  How often are off site backups updated?
    
Physical Security
    1.  Where is router stored, and how is it protected?
    2.  Where are any permanently wi-fi connected devices stored, and how are they protected?
    3.  Who has access to these locations?
    4.  Are there any publicly accessible ethernet ports?
    5.  How old are the locks on the building?
    
AAA (Authorization/Authentication/Accounting)
    1.  In what ways can users access the network?
    2.  How are users of the network identified and categorized?
    3.  What sorts of privileges do different users have?
    4.  How is user activity tracked and monitored?
    5.  Is any AAA software being used for the network?
    
User Education
    1.  Is there a standard procedure to follow when users transfer data over network?
    2.  Do users understand common sources of threat risks?
    3.  Are users encouraged to exercise secure data management practices?
    4.  Has there been a history of previous data leaks at this network?
    5.  What is the contingency plan for handling a data leak?
